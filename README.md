#      42 Philosophers   #
The "42 Philosophers" project is a classic exercise in the 42 Network that challenges you to solve the dining philosophers problem using threads and synchronization techniques. This project delves into the complexities of threading, processes, and managing shared memory spaces. Inspired by the famous "philosophers' dinner" thought experiment, the project tasks you with implementing a solution where multiple philosophers must share a limited number of resources (such as forks) without encountering deadlocks or starvation. Through this project, you'll gain a deep understanding of synchronization, resource management, and the intricacies of concurrent programming.
